# What is IOT ?

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity—that enables these objects to collect and exchange data.The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure,creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy and economic benefit;when IoT is augmented with sensors and actuators, the technology becomes an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems,
which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, intelligent transportation and smart cities.
